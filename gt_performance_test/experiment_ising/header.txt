    This folder contains all the data for a performance evaluation of the inference algorithm.
    The algorithm is tested using input data generated from simulated Ising-Glauber dynamics.
    The graphs used in this test are synthetic, undirected, and free of self-loops and multi-edges.
    They are generated from a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) with  N  nodes and approximately  N^0.3333333333333333  partitions.
    The probability of intra-partition connections is 0.999, while the probability of inter-partition connections is 0.001.
    This structure results in partitions that are highly likely to form disjoint connected components.
    The mean degree is set to k_mean = 4.
    The Ising dynamics is simulated for a fixed value of the inverse temperature beta = 1.
    The graphs is given uniform weights = 1/ k_mean. This combination of weights and inverse temperature
    results in a partially ordered regime for the Ising dynamics, thus enabling inference.

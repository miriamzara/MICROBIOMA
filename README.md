# MICROBIOMA

This repository contains various codes to perform the following tasks:
1) inspection of timeseries consisting of measures of relative abundances of species in subjects over time
2) network inference from the timeseries using stepwise linear regression
3) network inference from the timeseries using graph-tool.inference algorithms

Due to storage limitations on both GitHub and Git LargeFileStorage, the data used to benchmark the performance of 
graph-tool.inference algorithm is made available on the following Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1elYXR-QIgKF7pjGVgYqrbrfcmDNLuGmL?usp=sharing
